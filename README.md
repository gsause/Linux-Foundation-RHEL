# Get to Know üêß

Welcome to the **Don't know where to start with Linux** repository. This is explicitly for interns and beginners to understand Linux from the ground up.

Earth's IT industry runs on opensource software/tools, from which extra feature additions and customer support are sold for cash. To evolve in this landscape you should experience opensource because it‚Äôs transparent, collaborative, auditable, and free. It‚Äôs a digital democracy where your contributions can literally move the world forward without needing to pay, just to access the environment. You don‚Äôt need a license, subscription, or corporate approval to get started. Everything is out in the open, ready for you to explore, learn, break, fix, and build. Whether you‚Äôre a student in a small town or an engineer in a top tech firm, the playing field is level. That‚Äôs the power of open source and Linux sits right at the centre of it.

Linux holds about 45% of the global server operating system market in enterprise environments as of 2024 in which Red Hat Enterprise Linux alone represents a significant portion of it. It is the preferred choice for cloud infrastructure and modern enterprise applications, powering over 90% of public cloud workloads [ref.](https://www.sci-tech-today.com/stats/linux-statistics/)
